**Validation Criteria:**
- All documents created on or after 17 December 2025 must reference "2025" in date headers
- Historical events (e.g., "EUDR delayed in October 2024") remain unchanged
- Ambiguous references (e.g., "ISA v1.0 advisory lock (December 2024)") are clarified with explicit years

```
CRON_SETUP_GUIDE.md
ESG_INTEGRATION_FINAL_REPORT.md
GS1_ARTEFACTS_ALIGNMENT_VALIDATION.md
ISA_ESG_GS1_CANONICAL_MODEL.md
ISA_UX_STRATEGY.md
```

**Validation Method:**
1. Check Git commit history for file creation date
2. If created in December 2025, correct to 2025
3. If created in December 2024, dates are correct (no change)

---

## Ambiguous Historical References

### Issue: "ISA v1.0 advisory lock (December 2024)"

**Occurrences:**
- CHANGELOG_SUMMARY.md: Line 13, Line 592
- Multiple other documents referencing v1.0 lock

**Clarification Required:**
- When was ISA v1.0 advisory actually locked?
- December 2024 or December 2025?

**Resolution:**
Based on context, ISA v1.0 advisory was likely locked in **early December 2025** (not 2024). Evidence:
- ADVISORY_OUTPUTS.md: "Date: December 13, 2025" (v1.0 advisory delivery)
- CHANGELOG.md: "Last Updated: December 4, 2025"
- All recent advisory work references 2025

**Correction:**
- "ISA v1.0 advisory lock (December 2024)" → "ISA v1.0 advisory lock (December 2025)"
- Apply to all documents referencing v1.0 lock

---

## Validation Checklist

### Pre-Correction Validation
- [x] Identify all documents with 2024 date headers
- [x] Categorize documents by creation date (17 Dec, 16 Dec, 11 Dec)
- [x] Identify ambiguous historical references
- [ ] Validate file creation dates for Category 3 documents

### Correction Execution
- [ ] Correct 7 canonical documents (17 December 2025)
- [ ] Correct 7 UX documents (16 December 2025)
- [ ] Validate and correct 5 historical documents (11 December)
- [ ] Clarify ambiguous historical references (v1.0 lock date)

### Post-Correction Validation
- [ ] Verify all canonical documents reference 2025
- [ ] Verify no incorrect 2024 references in current documents
- [ ] Verify historical references are accurate and unambiguous
- [ ] Run automated temporal validation (if implemented)

---

## Automated Validation (Future)

### Pre-Commit Hook

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Check that document dates match current year

CURRENT_YEAR=$(date +%Y)
INCORRECT_DATES=$(grep -rn "^\*\*Date:\*\*.*202[0-4]" docs/ --include="*.md")

if [ -n "$INCORRECT_DATES" ]; then
  echo "ERROR: Incorrect document dates found (should be $CURRENT_YEAR):"
  echo "$INCORRECT_DATES"
  exit 1
fi
```

### CI/CD Validation

```yaml
# .github/workflows/temporal-validation.yml
name: Temporal Validation

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  validate-dates:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Check document dates
        run: |
          CURRENT_YEAR=$(date +%Y)
          INCORRECT_DATES=$(grep -rn "^\*\*Date:\*\*.*202[0-4]" docs/ --include="*.md")
          if [ -n "$INCORRECT_DATES" ]; then
            echo "ERROR: Incorrect document dates found"
            exit 1
          fi
```
