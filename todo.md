# ISA — Canonical TODO (root anchor)

This file is a stable entrypoint for agents and humans.

Primary entrypoints:
- AGENT_START_HERE.md
- docs/spec/
- docs/governance/
- docs/planning/ (if present)

Rules:
- Keep this file short: pointers + current top priorities only.
- Link to canonical planning docs; do not duplicate long roadmaps here.

## Current priorities
- [ ] Ensure PR #131 (root scripts → scripts/) passes CI and is merged.
- [ ] Define canonical DB layout (drizzle + migrations) under /db (prepare PR4).
- [ ] Classify docs/archive/root_docs into docs/spec, docs/governance, docs/runbooks, docs/architecture.


## Repository hygiene
- [ ] Repo assessment bundle: keep docs/reports ignored; maintain docs/reference/REPO_ASSESSMENT_HOWTO.md + scripts/audit runner as canonical
