# TODO (canonical)

This is the single canonical, live planning list for ISA.

Rules:
- Do not create additional TODO/Todo/todo planning files elsewhere in the repo.
- If legacy planning documents are found, migrate key items into this file or into `docs/planning/BACKLOG.csv`, then mark the legacy file as superseded or archive it under `isa-archive/`.
