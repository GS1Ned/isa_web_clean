# GS1 Position Paper: Accelerating Value Chain Digitalisation

**Source:** GS1 Position Paper on the use of GS1 standards and services as a tool to help companies address regulation more efficiently  
**Date:** 2024  
**Pages:** 14

## Executive Summary

This position paper addresses how traceability and transparency are emerging as strategic imperatives for companies to address ESG regulations. GS1 advocates for a **harmonized cross-regulation approach** rather than siloed compliance efforts.

**Key Message:** Companies should implement traceability solutions that address emerging regulatory requirements across regulations without unnecessarily duplicating efforts.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Regulation Classification

**Company-Level Regulations:**

- CSRD (Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive)
- CSDDD (Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive)
- TCFD (Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures)

**Product-Level Regulations:**

- EUDR (EU Deforestation Regulation)
- PPWR (Packaging and Packaging Waste Regulation)
- ESPR (Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation)
- DPP (Digital Product Passport)
- CPR (Construction Product Regulation)
- Batteries Regulation

### 2. Common Data Categories Across Regulations

The position paper identifies **common data categories** that appear across multiple ESG regulations:

1. **Contact Information** - Names, postal addresses, email addresses of businesses, individuals, operators, or traders involved in product creation
2. **Country of Production** - Country, trade register number or equivalent, of where product has been produced
3. **Product Description & Information** - Product name, information about the product's material composition including coding the origin of raw materials, intended use, life span and recyclability
4. **Quantity** - Quantity of the relevant product

### 3. Critical Tracking Events (CTEs)

**Definition:** CTEs are the critical events that must be recorded for effective traceability to be possible. These are instances where a product is moved, transformed, or otherwise requires data collection to be traceable through the value chain.

**Examples of CTEs:**

- CTE #1: Raw material sent to producer
- CTE #2: Raw material sent to producer
- CTE #3: Producer ships to distributor
- CTE #4: Producer ships to distributor
- CTE #5: [Intermediate steps]
- CTE #6: [Distribution steps]
- CTE #7: [Retail steps]
- CTE #8: [End consumer]

### 4. Key Data Elements (KDEs)

**Definition:** KDEs are the data points that must be captured at each CTE to ensure effective traceability and sufficient availability of traceability data.

**The 5W+1H Framework:**

- **Who** - Physical location handling a product (Where)
- **What** - Product identification
- **What** - Batch/lot numbers for received and delivered products (increased granularity)
- **What** - Quantity of manufactured or delivered products
- **When** - Time of receipt or delivery
- **What** - Identification of raw materials with corresponding batch numbers
- **Why** - Activity – what actually happens (e.g., assembly)

## Industry Challenges Identified

1. **Clarity on regulatory requirements** - Companies need clarity on what regulations require
2. **Standardisation of data generation and data sharing processes** - Non-standardised formats create inefficiency
3. **Lack of articulation of business value** - Beyond compliance, data sharing value is unclear
4. **Limited cross-value chain collaboration** - Siloed approach hinders transparency
5. **Lack of harmonisation across regulations** - Each regulation treated separately

**Key Problem:** Manual data sharing (email, Excel) remains widely used, creating challenges for interoperability, efficiency and scalability.

## GS1 Standards Recommendations

### 7-Step Implementation Approach

**4.1 Initial steps towards addressing the requirements:**

1. **Identify drivers and prioritised business needs** - Legal compliance, efficiency improvements, transparency towards consumers, environmental performance
2. **Map the product flow and identify Critical Tracking Events (CTEs)** - Create overview of entire product flow from origin to end of lifecycle
3. **Create pre-requisites for interoperability** - Identify traceable objects, places and parties through Key Data Elements (KDEs)
4. **Capture and share traceability data** - Data sharing between all actors, even those without direct business relationship
5. **Leverage existing identifiers and data carriers** - Build on existing identifiers (barcodes, QR codes) rather than introducing new schemes
6. **Collaborate across functions in the organisation** - Appoint responsible individual, foster cross-functional collaboration
7. **Collaborate with peers through trade associations** - Industry-wide understanding of challenges

### GS1 Standards for Traceability

**Identification Standards:**

- **GTIN** (Global Trade Item Number) - Product identification
- **GLN** (Global Location Number) - Party and location identification
- **Batch/Lot/Serial qualifiers** - Increased granularity for product tracking

**Data Sharing Standards:**

- **EPCIS** (Electronic Product Code Information Services) - Visibility event standard for sharing traceability data
- **GRP** (GS1 Registry Platform) - Global registry for GTINs and GLNs enabling searchability and data access
- **GDSN** (Global Data Synchronisation Network) - Product Master Data sharing
- **GS1 Web Vocabulary** - Semantic standard for product information
- **GDM** (Global Data Model) - Attribute definitions

**Data Carrier Standards:**

- **Barcodes** (1D and 2D)
- **QR codes with GS1 Digital Link**
- **RFID**

## Value Proposition

**Benefits of implementing GS1-based traceability:**

1. **Increased efficiency** - Digital ways-of-working, moving away from manual data generation, collection and sharing
2. **Correct basis for decision making** - Accurate, detailed and transparent data collection
3. **Future proofing value chains** - Scalability for emerging requirements

## Key Illustrations from Position Paper

1. **Company-level reporting categories** (CSRD/CSDDD):
   - Environmental: GHG emissions, energy consumption, water usage
   - Social: Employee matters, human rights
   - Governance: Business conduct

2. **Product-level information requirements** (DPP example):
   - Contact Information: Clothing Company, 123 Street, Stockholm

   - Product Description: Crew neck t-shirt, 100% cotton, recyclable at local textile recycling station
   - Quantity: 0.25 kg

3. **Value chain data layers:**
   - **Data generation** (standardised) - Common way to identify products, places, and packages
   - **Data collection and sharing** - Collection and sharing of primary and reference data
   - **Data processing** - Conversion, formatting and calculation of data
   - **Data reporting** - Regulatory reporting, compliance, investment decisions, procurement, product labeling

## ISA Integration Points

This position paper provides the **philosophical foundation** for ISA's approach:

1. **Cross-regulation harmonization** - ISA should emphasize common data categories across regulations
2. **CTE/KDE framework** - ISA should map regulations to specific CTEs and KDEs
3. **GS1 standards as enablers** - ISA should show how GTIN, GLN, EPCIS, GDSN enable compliance
4. **Value beyond compliance** - ISA should articulate efficiency, decision-making, and future-proofing benefits
5. **Full value chain view** - ISA should support upstream/downstream data consumers (authorities, consumers, trading partners)
