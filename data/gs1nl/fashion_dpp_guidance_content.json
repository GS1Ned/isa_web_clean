    "description": "The Digital Product Passport (DPP) is a mandatory electronic record required under the EU Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation (ESPR). For fashion and textile products, the DPP will contain comprehensive information about the product's environmental sustainability, enabling consumers, businesses, and regulators to make informed decisions.",
    "content": "The DPP for textiles aims to:\n\n1. **Improve circularity** - Enable better recycling and reuse by providing material composition data\n2. **Enhance transparency** - Give consumers access to sustainability information\n3. **Support compliance** - Help businesses meet ESPR and CSRD requirements\n4. **Combat greenwashing** - Provide verified, standardized sustainability claims\n\nKey timeline:\n- June 2026: EU DPP Registry launch\n- 2027: Green Claims Directive compliance\n- 2030: Full DPP requirements for textiles\n\nGS1 standards (GTIN, GLN, QR Code powered by GS1) are recognized as the foundation for DPP implementation.",
