Follow AGENTS.md as the canonical operating procedure.

Defaults:
- Evidence-first: do not assume. Verify in-repo or with authoritative sources.
- Prefer minimal diffs, reproducible automation, CI-first.
- For terminal output, use the single-script runner pattern (write /tmp/*.sh then bash it).
- Never commit to the default branch.
