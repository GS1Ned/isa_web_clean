# Regulatory landscape summaries

## Purpose

This document provides short, factual summaries of key regulatory areas relevant to ISA. It is supporting context for standards development and does not constitute advisory output.

## Scope and constraints

- Focus on EU and relevant Dutch initiatives
- Avoid speculative statements about future requirements
- Use this document to inform prioritisation, not to replace locked advisory outputs

## Coverage areas

### ESG reporting

- Corporate sustainability reporting requirements create structured disclosure needs that influence what product and supply chain data should exist and how it should be exchanged.

### Deforestation and traceability

- Supply chain traceability expectations increase the need for consistent event, location and provenance data.

### Digital Product Passport

- Product passport initiatives increase the need for consistent identifiers, link resolution and attributes supporting durability, repairability and circularity.

### Packaging and circularity

- Packaging and circularity initiatives increase demand for standardised packaging composition data, recyclability indicators and waste-related attributes.

## How ISA uses these summaries

ISA uses this document to:
- Identify candidate domains for future dataset acquisition
- Inform future advisory scope selection
- Provide non-binding context for GS1 NL standards planning

ISA does not use this document to:
- Generate new advisory conclusions
- Answer Ask ISA queries beyond locked artefacts



GS1 style checklist validation, line-by-line

If you want the strictest possible validation, paste the 7 files back here and I will do a true line-by-line audit against:
	•	British English spelling
	•	date format
	•	heading case
	•	abbreviation expansion
	•	Oxford comma detection
	•	tone and scope constraints


Checksums and Manus ingestion prompt

If you still want them included in the same response, say: “add checksum commands + Manus ingestion prompt”, and I’ll provide the exact sha256sum command and the single prompt to accompany these 7 files.
