# ISA Strategic Pivot: MVP → Proof of Concept

**Date:** December 2025  
**Status:** Active Directive

---

## Confirmed Decisions

- ✅ **Governance:** Transition from Lane C to Lane B approved
- ❌ **GitHub sync:** Do NOT activate yet
- ❌ **Advisory v1.1:** Do NOT publish externally
- 🔒 **External access:** GS1 NL staff only
- 🌍 **Language support:** No Dutch at this stage

---

## Core Intent Shift

ISA is now a **Proof of Concept (PoC)** focused on:

### What ISA IS:
- Demonstrating capabilities, integration patterns, technical feasibility
- Showcasing innovative AI techniques applied to ESG-GS1 mapping
- Proving value through feature quality and bidirectional integration
- Treating GS1 NL v3.1.34 as operational and sufficient

### What ISA is NOT:
- ❌ An MVP aiming at completeness or standard finalization
- ❌ A tool for producing/extending complete GS1 standards
- ❌ A comprehensive coverage platform (unless strictly necessary)
- ❌ A production-ready compliance system

---

## Development Focus Principles

### 1. Capabilities over Coverage
Improve and demonstrate **what ISA can do**, not **how much it covers**

### 2. Quality over Quantity
- Feature functionality
- Technical quality
- Performance
- Data pipelines suitable for demonstration use

### 3. Integration over Isolation
Prefer **fewer, deeply integrated capabilities** over many isolated ones

### 4. Innovation over Completion
Leverage **innovative AI techniques** and methodologies

### 5. Demonstration over Production
Build for **insight and capability demonstration**, not formal standard readiness

---

## Feature Evaluation Criteria

When proposing or developing features, consider:

✅ **Leverages innovative AI techniques** or methodologies  
✅ **Integrates bidirectionally** with existing ISA features  
✅ **Reinforces other features** (shared data, models, reasoning)  
✅ **Strong cost vs. benefit** justification  
✅ **Consumes outputs** from other ISA features  
✅ **Produces outputs** useful to other ISA features  

---

## Integration Mindset

Always ask:
1. How can this feature **consume outputs** from other ISA features?
2. How can this feature **produce outputs** useful to other ISA features?
3. What shared data, models, or reasoning can be leveraged?

---

## Planning Autonomy

You are **allowed and expected** to:

- ✅ Replan significantly
- ✅ Rewrite or replace planning documents
- ✅ Update architecture descriptions
- ✅ Discard outdated MVP/standard-finalization assumptions
- ✅ Keep documentation pragmatic and PoC-focused

⚠️ **However:** Surface major direction changes explicitly before proceeding

---

## Expectation Correction

You should be **fully aware of**:
- Current state and release cycle of GS1 NL, GS1 EU, GS1 Global publications
- Existing ESG-related content already authored by GS1 bodies

**Do NOT assume** new GS1 versions or extensions are required unless explicitly validated by research.

---

## Research and Feature Exploration Mandate

Actively research **additional high-value features** that ISA could offer.

### Prioritize features that:
1. Leverage innovative AI techniques or methodologies
2. Integrate bidirectionally with existing ISA features
3. Reinforce each other (shared data, shared models, shared reasoning)
4. Offer strong cost vs. benefit justification

### Explicitly:
- Compare feature ideas against each other
- Explain trade-offs
- Justify choices with research and analysis

---

## Immediate Action Plan

### Phase 1: Strategic Analysis (Current)
- [ ] Review existing documentation for MVP/completeness assumptions
- [ ] Identify documents needing rewriting or replacement
- [ ] Analyze current ISA capabilities and integration points

### Phase 2: High-Value Feature Research
- [ ] Research innovative AI techniques applicable to ESG-GS1 mapping
- [ ] Identify features with strong bidirectional integration potential
- [ ] Compare feature options and justify priorities

### Phase 3: PoC-Focused Roadmap Design
- [ ] Design capability-centered roadmap
- [ ] Create feature integration matrix
- [ ] Map bidirectional data flows

### Phase 4: Strategic Report Delivery
- [ ] Updated understanding of ISA purpose and scope
- [ ] Parts of existing plan/documentation needing change
- [ ] PoC-focused roadmap with feature interaction
- [ ] Short list of researched high-potential feature directions
- [ ] Questions/confirmations needed before proceeding

---

## Optimization Target

**Do NOT optimize for:**
- ❌ Perceived completeness
- ❌ Formal standard readiness
- ❌ Coverage metrics

**DO optimize for:**
- ✅ Insight
- ✅ Capability demonstration
- ✅ Architectural leverage
- ✅ Feature integration
- ✅ Innovation showcase

## Status: ACTIVE

This directive supersedes previous MVP-focused planning documents.
