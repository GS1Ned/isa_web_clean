# GS1 style quick reference

## Purpose

This is a quick reference for applying GS1 Style Guide Release 5.6 to ISA human-readable outputs.

## Applies to

Applies to:
- Advisory reports
- Governance documents
- Guidance and templates intended for GS1 stakeholders

Does not apply to:
- JSON schemas and API responses
- Code, database schemas and test artefacts

## High-impact rules

1. Use British English spelling
2. Use DD Month YYYY date format
3. Use sentence case headings
4. Spell out abbreviations on first use
5. Avoid Oxford commas
6. Use a neutral and factual tone
7. Keep terminology consistent across documents

## Examples

- Date: 15 January 2025
- Abbreviation: European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS)
- Heading: "Regulatory change log entry guide"
- List: "A, B and C"

## ISA conventions aligned to GS1

- Use stable IDs for advisory artefacts (MAP-*, GAP-*, REC-*)
- Cite versions for datasets, advisories and schemas
- Prefer short sentences and clear verbs
