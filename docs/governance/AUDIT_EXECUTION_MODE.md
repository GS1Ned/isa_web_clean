# AUDIT_EXECUTION_MODE

## Purpose

This document defines the **mandatory execution procedure** for audits, reviews, and validations within the ISA project.

Its purpose is to ensure that all audit-related work is:

* reproducible
* evidence-based
* conflict-aware
* resistant to assumption-driven conclusions

This document does **not** define governance authority.
It defines **how** audits must be executed, not **what** is governed.

---

## Scope

Audit Execution Mode applies **whenever** work involves:

* governance audits
* repository reviews
* golden path assessments
* validation of documentation, specifications, or structure
* claims about presence, absence, correctness, alignment, or currency

Audit Execution Mode is **always active** for such work and cannot be disabled.

---

## Mandatory Audit Preamble

Every audit deliverable **must begin** with the following metadata:

* **Date**: `YYYY-MM-DD`
* **Scope**: `READ-ONLY` or `WRITE`
* **Repository Reference**:

  * repository name
  * branch name
  * commit hash
* **Verification Method**:

  * commands executed, and/or
  * artifacts inspected

If any of the above elements are missing, the audit output is **invalid**.

---

## Evidence Rules

No claim may be made about whether something:

* exists or does not exist
* is correct or incorrect
* is aligned or misaligned
* is current, official, or valid
* works or fails

unless it is supported by **explicit evidence**.

Valid evidence consists of:

* concrete file paths
* command transcripts (e.g. `ls`, `find`, `git`)
* repository artifacts
* verifiable outputs

If evidence cannot be produced, the claim **must** be labeled:

**INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE**

No conclusions may be drawn from insufficient evidence.

---

## Mandatory Falsification

Every negative or critical claim (for example: “missing”, “incorrect”, “not aligned”, “incomplete”) must include:

1. an explicit attempt to falsify the claim
2. the evidence generated by that attempt

If falsification cannot be completed, the finding **must not escalate** and remains informational only.

---

## STOP Rules (Formal Execution State)

**STOP** is a formal and enforceable execution state.

STOP **must** be entered immediately when:

* two authoritative artifacts conflict
* evidence contradicts an earlier statement
* an instruction hierarchy conflict is detected
* a UI or tool instruction contradicts ISA Non-Negotiables

When STOP is active:

* no conclusions may be drawn
* no governance status may be changed
* no documentation may be updated
* no corrective actions may be implemented

Only the following output is permitted during STOP:

* a list of competing statements
* a description of their impact
* a description of the evidence required to resolve the conflict

STOP ends **only** after an explicit resolution is recorded.

---

## Canonical Anchors

Audit Execution Mode operates relative to the following canonical anchors:

* **Canonical specifications**: `docs/spec/`
* **Governance documentation**: `docs/governance/`

Any claim regarding missing, inconsistent, or invalid canonical material requires:

* a correct repository reference
* explicit filesystem evidence (for example: `ls`, `find` output)

Claims without such evidence are invalid.

---

## Relationship to Governance Authority

This document:

* does **not** introduce new governance rules
* does **not** override existing authority
* does **not** replace governance documentation

In case of conflict:

* **Permanent Project Instructions take precedence**
* Repository governance and canonical specifications take precedence over this document

This document defines **execution procedure only**.

---

## Required Output Structure

Every audit-related deliverable must include a section explicitly stating:

* what was **verified**
* what was **assumed**
* what could **not** be verified and why

---

## Enforcement Expectation

Any audit output that violates this execution mode is considered:

* procedurally invalid
* non-governance-grade
* subject to rejection or re-execution

---

## Status

This document is **canonical**.

It is binding for **audit execution behavior**,
and must be followed for all applicable work within the ISA project.
