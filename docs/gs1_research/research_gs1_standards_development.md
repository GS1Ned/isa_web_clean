# GS1 Standards Development Research

**Research Date:** 2025-12-19  
**Purpose:** Understand how GS1 standards are developed in practice to identify problem spaces where ISA could provide unique value

### Key Findings

**GSMP (Global Standards Management Process):**
- Community-based forum for businesses facing similar problems
- Standards created "by industry, for industry"
- GS1 acts as neutral facilitator (not decision-maker)
- Involves business and technical people from ~60 countries
- Industries: retail, consumer goods, fresh foods, healthcare, transport, logistics, governments

**Process Components Mentioned:**
1. Global Working Groups - industry experts and business teams develop standards
2. Work Request System - stakeholders can submit requests for new standards or enhancements
3. Community-based dialogue and development

**Neutrality Emphasis:**
- GS1 facilitates but does not dictate
- Multi-stakeholder participation required
- Consensus-driven approach implied

### Questions Raised (to investigate further)

1. How are conflicting stakeholder interests resolved?
2. What happens when economic impacts differ across supply chain actors?
3. How long does standards development typically take?
4. What causes delays or friction in the process?
5. How are trade-offs between alternative approaches evaluated?
6. What data/evidence is used to support design decisions?

## Next Steps

- Read GSMP Manual for detailed process
- Find case studies of actual standard development
- Research workgroup structure and decision-making
- Investigate pilot testing and validation processes
- Look for examples of regulatory pressure influencing standards

### Governance Structure
- **Global Standards Management Process (GSMP)** is the formal framework
- Multi-stakeholder participation: retailers, manufacturers, solution providers, regulators
- Regional representation through Member Organizations (MOs)
- Work groups organized by domain (Healthcare, Fresh Foods, Transport & Logistics, etc.)

### Standards Development Lifecycle
1. **Community Input Phase**: Issue identification from industry pain points
2. **Work Request**: Formal proposal with business case and scope
3. **Work Group Formation**: Subject matter experts convene
4. **Development**: Iterative drafting with pilot testing
5. **Community Review**: Public comment periods (typically 60-90 days)
6. **Ratification**: Consensus-based approval by GSMP Leadership Team
7. **Publication & Maintenance**: Version control, errata, periodic review

### Key Friction Points Observed
- **Consensus delays**: Balancing competing stakeholder interests (e.g., cost vs. granularity)
- **Pilot validation**: Standards often require real-world testing before ratification
- **Backward compatibility**: New versions must not break existing implementations
- **Regional variation**: Global standards need local adaptation (regulatory, language, infrastructure)
- **Technology evolution**: Standards must remain neutral yet accommodate emerging tech (IoT, blockchain, AI)

### Decision Tensions
- **Precision vs. Adoption**: More detailed standards = higher implementation barriers
- **Flexibility vs. Interoperability**: Allowing optionality reduces consistency
- **Speed vs. Consensus**: Fast-tracking standards risks stakeholder buy-in
- **Innovation vs. Stability**: Frequent updates create upgrade fatigue

### Documentation Requirements
- Business requirements documents (BRDs)
- Technical specifications
- Implementation guidelines
- Conformance requirements
- Use case libraries
- Impact assessments (cost, systems, training)
