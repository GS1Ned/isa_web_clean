Scope: P1 archaeology inventory of TODO/deferred work, feature maturity, and integration completeness.
Rules:
- Evidence-first: every row must cite path + excerpt/line or command output.
- STOP: if canonical authority is unresolved, inventory remains blocked.
- Secrets: no secret values in excerpts.
