-->

**Purpose:** [Why was this gap analysis conducted?]

**Scope:** [What standards, datasets or requirements were compared?]

**Key findings:**

- **Total gaps identified:** [N]
- **Critical gaps:** [N] (high impact, high urgency)
- **Moderate gaps:** [N] (medium impact, medium urgency)
- **Low-priority gaps:** [N] (low impact or low urgency)

**Impact:** [What is the business impact of these gaps?]

**Recommended actions:** [What should be done to address the gaps?]

---

## Methodology

### Comparison framework

**Source A:** [What is being assessed?]

- Dataset ID: `[dataset.id]`
- Version: [Version Number]
- Record count: [N]
- Coverage: [What does this dataset cover?]

**Source B:** [What is the benchmark or requirement?]

- Dataset ID: `[dataset.id]`
- Version: [Version Number]
- Record count: [N]
- Coverage: [What does this dataset require?]

### Gap classification

Gaps are classified using a 2×2 matrix:

| Impact | Urgency | Classification | Priority |
|--------|---------|----------------|----------|
| High | High | **Critical** | Address immediately (Q1-Q2) |
| High | Medium | **Moderate** | Address soon (Q3-Q4) |
| Medium | High | **Moderate** | Address soon (Q3-Q4) |
| Medium | Medium | **Low-priority** | Address later (next year) |
| Low | Any | **Low-priority** | Monitor, defer |

### Mapping confidence

Mappings are scored for confidence:

- **Direct:** 1:1 mapping with identical semantics (90-100% confidence)
- **Partial:** Approximate mapping requiring transformation (50-89% confidence)
- **Missing:** No suitable mapping exists (0-49% confidence)
