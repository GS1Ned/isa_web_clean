# GS1 Nederland Fashion/Textiles Sector Research

## Sector Overview

The Fashion & Textiles (Mode & textiel) sector is one of GS1 Nederland's key focus areas, with particular emphasis on:

1. **Digital Product Passport (DPP)** - Preparing for EU regulations
2. **RFID Implementation** - Better inventory management
3. **Sustainability/Traceability** - Circular economy transition
4. **CSRD Compliance** - Sustainability reporting

## Key Findings

### No Dedicated Fashion Datamodel

Unlike FMCG, DIY, and Healthcare sectors, there is **no dedicated Benelux Fashion/Textiles datamodel** on GS1 Benelux documentation portal. The Fashion sector appears to:

1. Use generic GS1 standards (GTIN, GLN, QR Codes)
2. Focus on DPP preparation rather than a sector-specific datamodel
3. Work on an international datamodel framework (mentioned as ongoing work)

### Available Resources

From GS1 Nederland Fashion sector page:
- Sectorstatement with Modint about DPP opportunities and challenges
- 5-step plan from Shopping Tomorrow for starting with DPP
- International working group for DPP datamodel (registration open until Feb 26)
- "Upstream apparel research" document about supply chain data sharing

### DPP Focus

The Fashion sector is heavily focused on Digital Product Passport preparation:
- Green Deal compliance
- CSRD reporting
- ESPR (Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation)
- Circular economy requirements

## Implications for ISA

Since there is no dedicated Fashion datamodel, ISA should focus on:

1. **DPP-specific content** for Fashion/Textiles
2. **ESPR requirements** for textiles
3. **Circularity data requirements** (recycled content, durability, repairability)
4. **Generic GS1 standards** applied to Fashion context

## Recommended Approach

Instead of ingesting a Fashion datamodel (which doesn't exist), we should:

1. Create a Fashion/Textiles sector template focusing on DPP
2. Add Fashion-specific sustainability guidance
3. Reference existing FMCG datamodel attributes that apply to Fashion
4. Include ESPR textile-specific requirements

## DPP Data Attributes for Textiles (from GS1 GO)

Source: https://support.gs1.org/support/solutions/articles/43000758759

The DPP data attributes for textile products may potentially include:

1. **Manufacturing location details**
2. **Records of border crossings** during transportation (import/export data)
3. **Information on raw materials** incorporated in the product
4. **Conditions during production** (wastewater management, worker safety standards)
5. **Environmental impact metrics** (carbon emissions, water consumption)
6. **Use of chemicals** (substances in manufacturing and dyeing processes)
7. **Information on recyclability** and end-of-life processing options
8. **Details on product durability** and repair possibilities
9. **Guidelines for proper care** to preserve product quality

Note: Exact requirements will be defined in the EU Textiles Delegated Act.

## ESPR Timeline for Textiles

- ESPR entered into force: July 18, 2024
- DPP Registry launch: June 2026
