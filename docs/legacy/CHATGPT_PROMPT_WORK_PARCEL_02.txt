You are generating the Ask ISA Query Library expansion for the ISA (Intelligent Standards Architect) project.

**Context:**
ISA is a read-only query interface over locked advisory artifacts that helps GS1 Netherlands stakeholders navigate ESG compliance requirements. The current advisory version is v1.1 (January 2025), covering 3 sectors (DIY, FMCG, Healthcare) and 5 critical gaps in GS1 NL sector models.

**Your task:**
Generate 30 example queries for the Ask ISA query library, distributed across 6 categories (5 queries per category). These queries will validate the RAG pipeline design and define allowed vs. prohibited question types.

**ISA Design Contract Constraints (CRITICAL):**

✅ **Allowed question types:**
1. Gap queries - "Which gaps exist for [regulation] in [sector]?"
2. Mapping queries - "Which GS1 NL attributes cover [ESRS datapoint]?"
3. Version comparison queries - "What changed between v1.0 and v1.1 for [topic]?"
4. Dataset provenance queries - "Which datasets underpin [recommendation]?"
5. Recommendation queries - "What are the short-term recommendations for [sector]?"
6. Coverage queries - "What is the coverage percentage for [ESRS topic] in [sector]?"

❌ **Prohibited question types:**
1. General ESG explanations - "What is CSRD?" → Refuse, redirect to official sources
2. Hypothetical questions - "What should GS1 do about DPP?" → Refuse, cite existing recommendations only
3. Speculative questions - "Will GS1 NL adopt PCF in 2026?" → Refuse, cite regulatory change log only
4. Out-of-scope questions - "How do I calculate Scope 3 emissions?" → Refuse, not advisory scope
5. Conversational prompts - "Tell me about sustainability" → Refuse, not a query interface

**Current ISA Advisory Scope (v1.1):**

**Sectors:**
- DIY/Garden/Pet (DHZTD) - GS1 NL v3.1.33 (1,221 attributes)
- FMCG (Food/Health/Beauty) - GS1 NL v3.1.33.5 (1,224 attributes)
- Healthcare (ECHO) - GS1 NL v3.1.33 (1,222 attributes)

**Regulations:**
- CSRD (Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive)
- ESRS (European Sustainability Reporting Standards) - E1, E2, E3, E4, E5, S1
- EUDR (EU Deforestation Regulation)
- CSDDD (Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive)

**Gap Status (v1.1):**
- Gap #1 (Product Carbon Footprint): PARTIAL (GS1 EU solution exists, GS1 NL adoption pending)
- Gap #2 (GS1 Digital Link Resolver): COMPLETE (GS1 resolver standard v1.1.0 published)
- Gap #3 (Digital Product Passport): PARTIAL (GS1 provisional DPP standard published)
- Gap #4 (Supplier Due Diligence): MISSING
- Gap #5 (Circularity Data): MISSING

**Dataset Registry (v1.3.0):**
- esrs.datapoints.ig3 - ESRS datapoints (EFRAG IG3, Sep 2024)
- gs1nl.benelux.diy_garden_pet.v3.1.33 - DIY sector model
- gs1nl.benelux.fmcg.v3.1.33.5 - FMCG sector model
- gs1nl.benelux.healthcare.v3.1.33 - Healthcare sector model
- gs1eu.gdsn.carbon_footprint.v1.0 - GS1 EU PCF standard (Feb 2025)

**Output format:**

Deliver queries in a Markdown table with the following columns:

| # | Query Text | Category | Sector | Expected Answer | Citations Required |
|---|------------|----------|--------|-----------------|-------------------|
| 1 | Which gaps exist for EUDR in FMCG? | Gap | FMCG | List of gaps with status (MISSING/PARTIAL/COMPLETE) | GAP-004, dataset IDs |
| 2 | Which GS1 NL attributes partially cover ESRS E1-6? | Mapping | All | List of attributes with coverage % | MAP-E1-6-*, gs1nl.benelux.*.v3.1.33 |

**Requirements:**

1. Generate exactly 30 queries (5 per category)
2. Distribute across 6 categories:
   - Gap queries (5)
   - Mapping queries (5)
   - Version comparison queries (5)
   - Dataset provenance queries (5)
   - Recommendation queries (5)
   - Coverage queries (5)

3. Ensure sector balance:
   - At least 8 queries for DIY sector
   - At least 8 queries for FMCG sector
   - At least 8 queries for Healthcare sector
   - Remaining queries can be cross-sector ("All")

4. Version awareness:
   - At least 5 queries must reference v1.0 vs v1.1 changes
   - Focus on Gap #1 status change (MISSING → PARTIAL)
   - Reference GS1 EU PCF standard adoption

5. Dataset traceability:
   - All queries must cite specific dataset IDs from registry v1.3.0
   - Use advisory ID patterns (GAP-001, MAP-E1-6-*, REC-*)
   - Reference section numbers where applicable

6. Realistic queries:
   - Questions GS1 NL stakeholders would actually ask
   - Focus on compliance pain points (CSRD, EUDR, DPP)
   - Prioritize short-term recommendations (2025-2026)

**Quality criteria:**

✅ 30 queries delivered in Markdown table format
✅ All 6 categories covered (5 queries each)
✅ All queries cite advisory IDs, dataset IDs, or sections
✅ All queries aligned to ISA Design Contract constraints
✅ All queries answerable from ISA v1.1 advisory scope
✅ Zero prohibited question types (no general ESG explanations or hypothetical questions)

**Example queries to inspire you:**

**Gap queries:**
- "Which gaps exist for EUDR in FMCG?"
- "What is the status of Gap #1 (Product Carbon Footprint) in Healthcare?"
- "Which critical gaps remain MISSING across all sectors?"

**Mapping queries:**
- "Which GS1 NL attributes partially cover ESRS E1-6 (Gross Scopes 1, 2, 3)?"
- "What is the coverage percentage for ESRS S1 (Own workforce) in DIY?"
- "Which FMCG attributes map to EUDR deforestation risk datapoints?"

**Version comparison queries:**
- "What changed between ISA v1.0 and v1.1 for Gap #1?"
- "Which gaps were upgraded from MISSING to PARTIAL in v1.1?"
- "What new datasets were added in registry v1.3.0?"

**Dataset provenance queries:**
- "Which datasets underpin the Product Carbon Footprint recommendation?"
- "What is the source of ESRS E1-6 datapoint definitions?"
- "Which GS1 NL sector model version is used for DIY analysis?"

**Recommendation queries:**
- "What are the short-term recommendations for FMCG?"
- "Which recommendations require GS1 EU standard adoption?"
- "What is the priority ranking for Gap #3 (Digital Product Passport)?"

**Coverage queries:**
- "What is the coverage percentage for ESRS E1 (Climate) in Healthcare?"
- "Which ESRS topic has the highest coverage in DIY?"
- "What percentage of EUDR datapoints are covered in FMCG?"

**Deliverable:**

Provide the 30 queries in a single Markdown code block, formatted as a table with the 6 columns specified above. Include a brief validation summary confirming:
1. Category distribution (5 queries per category)
2. Sector balance (at least 8 per sector)
3. Version awareness (at least 5 queries)
4. Zero prohibited question types

**GS1 Style Guide compliance:**
- Use British English spelling
- Use sentence case for query text
- Expand abbreviations on first use (e.g., "CSRD (Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive)")
- No Oxford commas
- Neutral, non-promotional tone
