# docs/misc/_root

This folder contains documents that previously lived at repository root and were moved here for cleanup.

## Rule
- Do not add new content here.
- Promote documents to a canonical location (`docs/planning`, `docs/spec`, `docs/governance`) when their category is clear.
- If a document is historical output/report, move it to `isa-archive/`.

## Promotion checklist
- Update internal links (if any).
- Add a short "Status:" banner at top indicating canonical successor, if superseded.
