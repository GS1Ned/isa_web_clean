## Section 1: Introduction (Page 8)

**Purpose of GS1 Style Guide:**

GS1 is a multinational organisation with writers located all over the world. Without a unified GS1 documentation style, problems with inconsistency and poor readability can occur across documents and across departments.

A document with typographical errors, ungrammatical constructs, or inconsistent structure and format can create questions about the accuracy of the content itself and ultimately reflects poorly on GS1 as a whole. Writers who dismiss the importance of presentation (consistent style, format, word use and so on) risk dissatisfied and unhappy readers.

**Key Purposes:**
1. To set rules and conventions for grammatical style, standardised spellings, proper word usage and correct punctuation
2. To provide guidelines for writing procedures and scenarios, as well as using graphics
3. To provide a standard, unifying document that all writers in GS1, regardless of their level or function, can or use to easily and quickly improve the quality and consistency of their documentation

**Important Reference:** GS1 standards glossary of terms: www.gs1.org/glossary

---

## Section 2: Applicable to all GS1 documentation

### 2.1 GS1 Spelling Rules (Page 9)

**Primary Rule:** All GS1 documentation (press release, training, standard, website, etc.) use consistent spelling and style. The chosen GS1 spelling and style is **British English per the Collins online dictionary**.

**Note:** When using MS Word, set the language to English (U.K.).

**Table 2-1: Examples of spelling conversions**

| American English | British English |
|------------------|-----------------|
| analyze | analyse |
| artifact | artefact |
| center | centre |
| defense | defence |
| license* | licence |
| liter | litre |
| organization | organisation |
| organize | organise |
| pre-defined | predefined |
| program | programme |
| serialization | serialisation |
| standardize | standardise |
| synchronization | synchronisation |

*Note: In British English licence with a c is used for the noun and license with an s is used for the verb.

---

### 2.1.1 Exceptional Spelling Rules for GS1 Machine-Readable Artefacts (Page 9)

**Definition:** A machine-readable artefact is defined as: *Any GS1 technical file, which may be part of a GS1 standard, guideline or service, where the intended use is for direct machine-to-machine interpretation. This includes but is not limited to: GS1 Web Vocabulary; Application Programming Interfaces (APIs); Machine-readable code; Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs).*

**Exception:** For such items, the **US spellings per the Merriam-Webster English Dictionary** shall be used.

**Rationale:** Most machine-readable artefacts are based on 3rd party platforms, such as https://www.schema.org/ and https://www.w3.org/, which themselves are based on US English.

---

### 2.2 Terminology Rules (Pages 9-10)

**Primary Reference:** Use www.gs1.org/glossary to define and research terminology.

**Registered Trademark Symbol ®:**
- Use the registered trademark symbol ®, the first time any GS1 registered trademark appears in the document and only once.
- If the first occurrence is a heading, use the symbol in the next occurrence.
- Example: GS1 DataBar® is the preferred barcode symbol (first occurrence).

**Exception:** Do not use ® on GS1 since the ® sign is included in the logo and the words "GS1 and the GS1 logo are registered trademarks of GS1 AISBL" are always included in the disclaimer.

**Non-exhaustive list of registered trademarks held by GS1:**
- DataBar®
- EAN®
- EANCOM®
- EPCglobal® *limited use with regard to legal entity*
- GDSN®
- GS1®

**Follow these additional guidelines for terminology:**
- barcode *is one word*
- business-to-business (B2B)
- business-to-business-to-consumer (B2B2C)
- business-to-consumer (B2C)
- business-to-government (B2G)
- data pool *is two words*
- database *is one word*
- defence
- e-commerce
- e-tailer
- email *is one word and does not include a hyphen*
- EPC/RFID for standards and guidelines. *RAIN RFID may be used in marketing and communications material ONLY.*
- EU Food Information Regulation 1169/2011 (EU 1169)
- European Union (EU)
- go to market
- Industry/industries – use when referring to all industry sectors
- internet
- Marketplaces *is one word*
- omni-channel
- online *is one word and does not include a hyphen. Use this term when referring to the media type, rather than alternatives such as "web"*
- order-to-cash
- point-of-sale (POS)
- Verified by GS1 *never GS1 Verified or VbG*
- web
- webpage *is one word*
- website *is one word*

## Next Steps

Continue extracting rules from remaining sections (2.3-2.21, Section 3, Section 4, Section 5) to complete the 10-20 highest-impact rules for ISA.

---

### 2.3 Use Sentence Case for Headings (Page 11)

**Rule:** Minimising the use of capital letters in headings makes them easier to read, so use sentence case – when only the first word is capitalised.

**Rationale:** Overuse of capitals can make text more difficult to read; use of lowercase gives us a more relaxed and approachable tone of voice.

**Examples:**
- ✅ Correct: GS1 helps companies drive efficiency and safety
- ❌ Incorrect: GS1 helps companies drive Efficiency and Safety
- ✅ Correct: Our business benefits in retail
- ❌ Incorrect: Our Business Benefits in Retail

---

### 2.3.1 Capitalisation of Terms (Pages 11-12)

**Rule:** For GS1 terms, follow the style shown in the www.gs1.org/glossary. Use initial capital letters for nouns that identify a particular person, place or thing, including the proper name of an entity.

**Critical Note:** Do **NOT** capitalise initial letter of the word "standard" even when using with GS1 unless referencing the title of a specific document (e.g., GS1 Digital Link Standard).

**Rationale:** Minimal use of capitals makes text easier to read; use of lowercase gives us a more relaxed and approachable tone of voice; GS1 is an adjective describing "standards" in this case.

**Examples:**
- ✅ Correct: GS1 is a standards organisation
- ✅ Correct: GS1 develops global standards
- ✅ Correct: GS1 standards help companies improve supply chain efficiency
- ❌ Incorrect: GS1 Standards help companies improve supply chain efficiency

**Spelling for terms that begin with capital letters when GS1 is used as part of the name:**
- GS1 Application Identifiers
- GS1 Architecture Principles
- GS1 Company Prefix
- GS1 Data Quality
- GS1 Data Quality Framework (DQF)
- GS1 DataBar
- GS1 DataMatrix (note *Data Matrix* is the generic symbology used to encode GS1 Digital Link)
- GS1 Digital Link
- GS1 EANCOM
- GS1 EDI
- GS1 EPCglobal
- GS1 General Specifications
- GS1 Global Data Model
- GS1 GLN Registry
- GS1 GLN Service
- GS1 Global Data Synchronisation Network (GDSN)
- GS1 Global Electronic Party Information Registry (GEPIR)
- GS1 Global Registry Platform (GRP)
- GS1 Global Standards Management Process (GSMP)
- GS1 identification key
- GS1 Licence Registry (used to power the GDSN)
- GS1 Logistics Interoperability Model (LIM)
- GS1 Navigator
- GS1 Prefix
- GS1 QR Code (note *QR Code* is the generic symbology used to encode GS1 Digital Link)
- GS1 System Architecture
- GS1 XML
- Verified by GS1

---

### 2.3.2 Capitalisation in Abbreviations (Page 12)

**Rule:** When an abbreviation is first used in a document, spell out the term it replaces using initial capital letters.

**Rationale:** Abbreviations and acronyms are not readily understood by people who are new to GS1.

**Examples:**
- ✅ Correct: The Global Data Synchronisation Network (GDSN) allows companies to share data
- ❌ Incorrect: GDSN allows companies to share data

**Exceptions:**
- The abbreviation "ID" is the conventional acronym for the word "identification".
- Avoid using confusing or easily mixed up acronyms in one document (e.g., GCP (Global Company Prefix) and GPC (Global Product Classification)).

**Exceptions: Terms where GS1 places the abbreviation before its explanation:**
- UHF (Ultra High Frequency)
- HF (High Frequency)
- RFID (Radio Frequency Identification)
- EPC (Electronic Product Code)
- EPC-enabled RFID (in general) or EPC/RFID (when shortened version needed)

---

### 2.3.3 Capitalisation of GS1 Keys (Page 12)

**Rule:** When referring to GS1 keys, the following list of terms shall be used if the intent is to be comprehensive:

- Global Trade Item Number (GTIN)
- Global Location Number (GLN)
- Serial Shipping Container Code (SSCC)
- Global Returnable Asset Identifier (GRAI)
- Global Individual Asset Identifier (GIAI)
- Global Service Relation Number (GSRN)
- Global Document Type Identifier (GDTI)
- Global Shipment Identification Number (GSIN)
- Global Identification Number for Consignment (GINC)
- Global Coupon Number (GCN)
- Component/Part Identifier (CPID)
- Global Model Number (GMN)

---

### 2.4 Document Title Formatting in Running Text (Page 13)

**Rule:** Unlinked titles of documents should always be italicised in running text. However, do not italicise the words "section", "chapter", "appendix", "table" or "figure" and do not italicise the titles and numbers of a section, chapter, appendix, table or figure.

**Examples:**
- ✅ Correct: See the *Microsoft Style Guide*
- ✅ Correct: See the Microsoft Style Guide (hyperlinked)
- ❌ Incorrect: See the *Microsoft Style Guide* (hyperlinked)

**Note:** When referring to specific document titles in references or hyperlinks, avoid including the date the document was published, released, or approved, or include its issue number unless it is critical to the context.

---

### 2.5 Abbreviation and Symbol Rules (Page 13)

This section describes the rules for using abbreviations and symbols.

**Note:** For currency abbreviation rules, see section 2.14.9.

---

### 2.5.1 Use of Symbols (Page 13)

**Key rules:**
- Do not abbreviate the word "and" as "&" unless the word appears in a figure or table that has limited space.
- Do not abbreviate the word "plus" as "+" unless the word appears in a figure or table that has limited space.
- Never abbreviate the word "degrees" as "°."
- Never abbreviate numbers, such as first, second, third, or fourteenth, using the conventions "st," "nd," "rd," or "th."

---

### 2.5.2 Dates (Page 13)

**Key rules:**
- If not spelled out in full, use the format **DD MM YYYY** for expressing dates. No punctuation is used between day, month or year.

**Examples (full format, month spelled out):**
- ✅ Correct: The new standard was released on 1 December 2024
- ❌ Incorrect: The new standard was released on December 1, 2014

**Examples (abbreviated format):**
- ✅ Correct: 1 Dec 2024
- ❌ Incorrect: 01 Dec 2024
- ❌ Incorrect: 1-12-24, 12-1-24, Dec-1-24

---

### 2.6 Punctuation and Grammar Rules (Page 14)

**Note:** See section 2.14.9 for punctuation of currency.

---

### 2.6.1 Hyphens in Compound Words (Page 14)

**Note:** See section 2.2 for guidance on hyphen use in technical terminology.

**Rule:** In running text, always hyphenate compound words that are hyphenated in the www.gs1.org/glossary or the dictionary. If a term is not hyphenated in the www.gs1.org/glossary, do not add a hyphen.

**Examples:**
- ITF-14
- X-dimension
- self-evident
- wall-to-wall

**Rule:** In running text, hyphenate compound words when they are common English expressions that might be confusing or ambiguous without the hyphens.

**Examples:**
- ship-to address
- end-user manuals
- in-store sale
- point-of-sale

**Note:** In most cases compound words that are **NOT** used directly before a noun are not hyphenated.

**Examples:**
- Decision making is one of his responsibilities. (but) His decision-making skills were superb.
- I'm good at problem solving. (but) Problem-solving activities are educational.

---

### 2.6.2 Prefixes and Suffixes (Page 14)

**Rule:** A prefix or suffix usually combines with a word without a hyphen or space, as in *dehumidify* and *lifelike*, unless the meaning could be misconstrued.

**Examples:**
- Untie the knot.
- He recovered in time to attend the meeting. (but) He re-covered the illegible label with a new one.

---

### 2.6.3 Spacing (Page 14)

**Rule:** After a full stop or a colon place a single space. Do not use a double-space.

---

### 2.6.4 Use of "may" versus "can" (Page 14)

**Rule:**
- Can means **"to be able."**
- May means **"to have permission."**

---

### 2.6.5 Use of "that" versus "which" (Page 15)

**Rule:**
- Use **"that"** to introduce a dependent clause (sometimes called a limiting or defining clause). These are clauses that cannot be removed from the sentence without greatly affecting the sentence's meaning.
- Use **"which"** to introduce an independent clause (sometimes called a non-defining or parenthetical clause). Independent clauses can be removed from the sentence without harming the basic sense of the sentence.

**Note:** "which" is almost always preceded by a comma and introduces an independent clause.

**Examples:**
- The ID number, which is located on the label, should be clearly legible.
- The digit that is in position thirteen is the check digit.

---

### 2.6.6 Using "e.g." (Page 15)

**Rule:** To give the reader examples of something in running text, use the initials "e.g." This stands for the Latin phrase meaning "for example" or "such as". Do not confused with "i.e.," which means "that is."

**Note:** A comma should always follow the second full stop in "e.g."

**Example:**
- Products modified for seasonal reasons (e.g., holiday packs) should carry a unique GTIN-12.

---

### 2.6.7 Using Several Examples in Running Text (Page 15)

**Rule:** When presenting several examples in running text following "e.g.," it is not necessary to include the word "and" or "or" prior to the last example unless the word helps to clarify the sentence's meaning.

**Examples:**
- Visually inspect the imaging tool for damage (e.g., nicks, plugs, tears).
- Barcodes require dark colours for bars (e.g., black, dark blue, dark brown or dark green).

---

### 2.6.8 Do Not Use Comma Before "and" (unless necessary) (Page 15)

**Rule:** Do not use a comma before "and" and "or" in a series.

**Examples:**
- ✅ Correct: The new standard enables efficiency, sustainability and safety.
- ❌ Incorrect: The new standard enables efficiency, sustainability, and safety.

**Exception:** There are examples where a comma is necessary after the "and" or "or" for clarity. In such cases the Oxford comma should be used.

**Examples:**
- ✅ Correct: Karen went to the meeting with her sisters, Paul, and John
- ❌ Incorrect: Karen went to the meeting with her sisters, Paul and John

---

### 2.6.9 Parentheses with GS1 Application Identifiers (Page 15)

**Rule:** Include parentheses around a GS1 Application Identifier except when it is used in a table or figure.

**Example:**
- Use the GS1 Application Identifier (8100) for coupons.

---

## Next Steps

Continue extracting from sections 2.7-2.21 and Section 3 to complete the highest-impact rules for ISA.

### 2.7 Figures, Tables and Flowcharts (Pages 16-17)

#### Figures

**Purpose:** Figures enhance a document's readability by illustrating key points, better communicating ideas and helping readers navigate through sometimes confusing interfaces.

**Key recommendations:**
- Avoid using figure titles and numbering at all, if the figure is well positioned and explained by the text (e.g., "as shown in the figure below:"), such that a title would be superfluous.
- Position the figure number and title below the image, preferably with both image and title being centred.

**Figure numbering format:** [Highest level section number] - [the sequential figure number within the highest level section number]

**Note:** Using the GS1 Word templates will automatically create the correct figure and table caption numbering in your documents.

#### Tables

**Purpose:** Tables display lengthy and complex information in a simple format and enable readers to quickly find, compare, classify, etc.

**Note:** When publishing as HTML, large tables often look unwieldy and other presentation formats should be considered.

**Table format:** If tables are used, they should use the default format provided in the GS1 Word template with GS1 blue filled title heading and 50% grey fill for secondary headings.

**Table numbering format:** [Highest level section number] - [the sequential table number within the highest level section number] and should appear above the table flush left.

**Example:** Table 2-1: An example of a GS1 table heading

**Note:** Any notes in the table should be included the last row of the table.

#### Flowcharts

**Purpose:** Flowcharts are excellent for showing system logic or other flows.

**Best practice:** Ideally, they should be created as separate files – using an appropriate software like Adobe Illustrator – and imported into the document as an image. When inserted they should be labelled as figures.

---

### 2.8 Images and Flowcharts (Pages 17-20)

**Context (2025):** At the time of writing there are several emerging challenges for GS1 in terms of images and flowcharts:

1. Making the text held within images searchable (for any image posted as part of an HTML page)
2. Compatibility with ISO image standards (where GS1 standards are transposed to ISO standards either as a whole or in part)
3. Having published images scale to fit the screen (the same image can appear on a mobile device or a large PC screen)
4. Sharing, storing and reusing images across GS1 (services, standards, marketing, etc.)

**High-level summary of new guide:**
- Changes to existing images used in existing standards and guidelines are not required.
- New images are ideally created in Adobe Illustrator:
  - Saved as separate editable files in a folder associated with the text file (Word document).
  - Inserted in the document in *.SVG format
- Images of barcodes require dark colours for bars and light colours for the spaces. 2D barcodes follow the same colour rules, however they can use reverse reflectance (white on black) see the 2D in Retail Colour and Quality Guideline for more details.

**Open questions:**
- Naming convention for the image files / folder?
- Location for saving image files associated with a standard or guideline?
- Consistency of images within a given standard or guideline and across GS1?
- Links to other sections: GS1 prefix 952 for examples, Figures, tables and flowcharts

---

### 2.8.1 Adobe Illustrator (Page 18)

**Recommendation:** GS1 recommend Adobe Illustrator for the creation of new images. To be compatible with the ISO image standards the following defaults are recommended for a new image:

- Width 170 mm, height 225 mm
- Portrait orientation
- 1 artboard
- Bleed 0, 0, 0, 0
- Color mode CMYK

---

### 2.8.2 Accessibility for All (Page 18)

**Principle:** Every effort should be made to ensure GS1 documentation is accessible to all. For extensive details, please see the EAA European Accessibility Act regulation, but some good working practices are:

#### 2.8.2.1 Images Should Have a Text Description

**Rule:** Images must have a text description ("alt text" for readers with visual disability). If a flow chart is an essential part of the text (especially if it's normative) then a full description can be provided in a separate document. This won't be necessary if the flowchart clarifies what is defined in the text.

#### 2.8.2.2 Do Not Use ONLY Colour to Convey Meaning

**Rule:** Do not use colour as the exclusive way to convey meaning. Not all readers can distinguish between colours and, if viewed in black and white, the meaning will be unclear. Patterned shading can be used or dots and dashes, rather than colours, to differentiate between lines on a graph.

**Example:** The guide shows two versions of a "Downloads in 2025" line chart:
- ✅ Correct: Uses different line styles (solid, dashed, dotted) to distinguish between "GS1 Electronic Data Interchange", "GS1 Global Data Model", and "GS1 Services"
- ❌ Incorrect: Uses only different colors (orange, green, blue) to distinguish the same three lines

---

### 2.8.3 Inserting Images and Flowcharts (Pages 19-20)

**Context:** Images on screen can appear identical to the naked eye but behave quite differently in terms of load time, visual quality, background-colours, editability, etc. depending on where the image is being used. It is therefore important to keep the intended usage in mind when developing or inserting images.

#### 2.8.3.1 File Types for Print

**Rule:** SVG is preferred. EPS, TIFF and JPG image formats may be used for print materials such as brochures, posters, banners, postcards, etc. These formats should always be saved in a CMYK colour space.

#### 2.8.3.2 File Types for Digital

**Rule:** SVG is preferred. PNG, JPG and GIF image formats may be used for digital pieces such as PowerPoints, Word documents, web pages, social media posts, emails, etc. These formats should always be saved in an RGB colour space.

##### 2.8.3.2.1 HTML

**Context:** Increasingly GS1 standards and guidelines, as well as other GS1 publications, are being published as webpages (e.g., using HTML) using images that:
- can scale with the screen
- are quick to load

**Recommendation:** The most appropriate format in this case is normally SVG (Scalable Vector Graphic). Readability, particularly of images or flow charts containing text, will be optimised even when viewed on small screens.

##### 2.8.3.2.2 Images in Word

MS Word enables different ways for images appear in documents.

**For material that will appear in HTML:**
- See HTML section above
- Images should be formatted as *.svg

**For material that will appear in print or PDF:**
- Recommend format *.png (aligned with images available from GS1 marketing)

**For all images inserted into MS Word:**
- Insert images using the MS Word Command *Insert > Picture* then browse to the image file and ensure that the text wrapping option for the image is *In Line with Text*.
- Do **NOT** use the option "link to file" when you insert or embed an image. This links the Word document to the image file stored on your computer. When the file is exchanged with others, this link may cause problems. Also avoid using copy-paste of images.
- Maintain all original artwork with Word (editable) version of documents. If you create your own, these should be part of the final files sent for posting to the website. Any graphic tool can be used to create *.png format images. PowerPoint is a simple and easy to use graphic editing tool and files can be saved using the *same-file-name.pptx* as the file to be posted.
- Avoid any text in images (not translatable).
- Avoid creating images in Word due to formatting (anchoring) issues and compatibility between the various versions of Word.
- Do not use Word to crop an image. If an image needs to be cropped, do this using image software and insert the entirety of the cropped image into the document.

---

### 2.9 Bulleted Lists (Page 20)

**Purpose:** Bulleted lists are used for cases where the order of information is not important.

**Rules for bulleted lists:**
- A bulleted list should contain at least two bullets.
- Introduce the list with at least one lead-in sentence (or sentence fragment) ending with a colon, for example, see the lead-in sentence above.
- After the colon, capitalise the first word of each list item, even if it is a single word.
