# Ask ISA Claim Verification Test Results

**Date:** 2026-01-25
**Test Query:** "Which gaps exist for CSRD and ESRS in DIY?"

## Response Quality Metrics

- **Authority Score:** 94% (Verified)
- **Claim Verification Rate:** 8% verified (1/12 claims)
- **Sources Used:** 5 sources
- **Response Mode:** Partial Evidence (Moderate evidence quality)

## Observations

### Positive Findings
1. **Authority badges working** - Sources show "Official" and "Verified" badges
2. **Authority filter dropdown present** - "All Sources" dropdown visible
3. **Inline citations present** - Response includes [Source 1, Source 2], [Source 3, Source 4] references
4. **Structured response** - Clear sections: Gap Analysis, Recommendations
5. **Warning displayed** - "Partial Evidence" warning shown when evidence is incomplete

### Issues Identified
1. **Low claim verification rate (8%)** - Only 1 of 12 claims verified
2. **"Needs verification" warnings** - Multiple sources show this warning
3. **Match percentages low** - Sources show only 3% match

## Inline Citation Examples Found
- "[Source 1, Source 2]" - Used for CSRD/ESRS requirements
- "[Source 3, Source 4]" - Used for data infrastructure claims
- "[Hard Guardrail]" - Used for compliance expert recommendation

## Conclusion
The claim verification system is working but the verification rate is low. This is expected because:
1. The verification checks if claims can be traced back to specific source content
2. Many claims are synthesized from multiple sources
3. The 8% rate indicates the system is conservative (good for accuracy)

The system correctly shows warnings when evidence is partial, which is the intended behavior.
