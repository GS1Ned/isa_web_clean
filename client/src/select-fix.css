/**
 * Fix for Radix UI Select dropdown closing on desktop browsers
 * 
 * Problem: On desktop (Chrome, Safari), the dropdown closes immediately when
 * moving mouse from trigger to menu items because Radix UI loses focus.
 * 
 * Solution: Add a small invisible bridge between trigger and content to maintain
 * hover state, and prevent pointer events from closing the dropdown prematurely.
