# ISA Next-Generation Capability Exploration - TODO

## Phase: Solution Space Mapping (Non-Execution)

### Capability Map Development
- [x] Identify major capability domains for next-generation ISA
- [x] Map integration points with existing ISA baseline
- [x] Define 2-3 architectural approaches per capability
- [x] Document what each approach would prove/invalidate
- [x] Establish learning objectives and validation criteria
- [x] Assess integration scenarios (extend/coexist/supersede)
- [x] Document risks and costs per approach

### Deliverables
- [x] Create ISA_CAPABILITY_MAP.md with solution space exploration (1,251 lines, 15 approaches across 5 domains)
- [x] Extract and refine 5 canonical gating questions (ISA_GATING_QUESTIONS.md v1.0)
- [x] Establish gating questions as standing decision framework for all future capability work

## Constraints
- NO execution or implementation
- NO UI/dashboard development
- NO architecture finalization
- KEEP all paths open and non-committal
- TREAT existing ISA as stable baseline and integration anchor
